This is my attempt at a Python kata for implementing the Minesweeper game. This kata was set as a coding challenge at the Python North West group in 2011, where this group meets on the third Thursday of each month at Madlab in Manchester.

The Minesweeper program must accept the Minesweeper board as a string of '-' or '*' characters, where '-' represents an empty square and '*' represents a mine. The program must then convert this into a completed Minesweeper board, where each square is labelled with its number of adjacent mines.

This solution enforces a square board, where the input string specifies the Minesweeper board one row at a time, not one column at a time.
